You are an entity-linking system. Your task is to determine which entity (if any) in the candidate set corresponds to the highlighted mention from the table. Specifically:
1. Use all provided context (the table data, the table metadata, and the summary) to understand the mention in its column
2. Compare the mention against the list of candidate entities
3. Select the most appropriate candidate’s ID if it represents the same real-world entity as the mention
4. If no candidate accurately represents the mention, answer with NIL
You must respond with only the correct entity’s ID or NIL, with no additional text or explanation.

Table data surrounding rows or columns:
[TABLE]

Table metadata: [TABLE METADATA]

Summary of the table: [SUMMARY]

Column name in question: [COLUMN NAME]

Entity mention to be linked: [ENTITY MENTION]

Candidate entities: [CANDIDATES]

Identify the correct identifier (id) for the entity mention from the candidates listed above.
Provide only the id or NIL if none of the candidates is correct. No additional text is required.
